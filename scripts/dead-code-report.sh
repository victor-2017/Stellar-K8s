# Generates a periodic dead-code and unused-config report (issue #1064).
#
# The report is informational: it always exits 0 and writes a Markdown
# summary to target/reports/dead-code-report.md so CI can upload it as an
# artifact. Set SKIP_CARGO=1 to skip the compiler pass (used for smoke tests)
# and DEAD_CODE_REPORT_OUT to write the report somewhere else.
# shell-safety: disable-file SH001 -- this report must survive a failing cargo pass
# and always exit 0, so `-e` is deliberately omitted from strict mode.
