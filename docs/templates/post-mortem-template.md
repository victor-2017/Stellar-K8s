# Incident Post-Mortem Template

Use this template within **5 business days** of resolving SEV-1 or SEV-2 incidents. SEV-3 post-mortems are optional but recommended for recurring issues.

Copy this file into your incident tracker or wiki and fill every section.

## Executive summary

[2–3 sentences: what happened, customer impact, and how it was resolved. Non-technical stakeholders should understand this section.]

---

## Impact assessment

### User and business impact

- **Stellar network:** [Ledger delays, consensus gaps, none]
- **API availability:** [Horizon/Soroban RPC error rate, duration]
- **Tenants affected:** [List namespaces / customers]
- **Financial impact:** [If applicable]

### Technical impact

- **Nodes affected:** [StellarNode names, namespaces]
- **Data integrity:** [Archive corruption, DB inconsistency — yes/no with details]
- **SLA breach:** [Yes/no against defined SLO]

---

## Timeline (UTC)

All times in UTC. Include detection, escalation, key decisions, and recovery.

| Time | Actor | Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HH:MM | Alertmanager | [Alert fired: StellarNodeDown] |
| HH:MM | On-call | [Acknowledged; opened incident channel] |
| HH:MM | IC | [Severity set to SEV-2; assigned runbook owner] |
| HH:MM | Engineer | [Mitigation step applied] |
| HH:MM | IC | [Declared resolved; monitoring period started] |

## Root cause analysis (RCA)

### What happened?

[Technical description of the failure chain — the proximate cause.]

### Why did it happen?

[Contributing factors: design gap, config error, capacity, human process, dependency failure.]

### Why did our defenses not prevent it?

[Monitoring gaps, missing alerts, insufficient testing, documentation drift.]

### Five whys (optional)

1. Why? →
2. Why? →
3. Why? →
4. Why? →
5. Why? → [Root cause]

## Detection and response evaluation

### What went well?

- [e.g., Fast detection via `stellar_node_ingestion_lag` alert]
- [e.g., Runbook steps were accurate]
- [e.g., Cross-team communication]

### What could be improved?

- [e.g., Alert threshold too high]
- [e.g., Missing runbook for edge case]
- [e.g., Slow credential rotation]

## Mitigation and resolution

[Detailed steps taken to restore service, including commands, config changes, and rollbacks. Link to PRs.]

## Corrective and preventive actions

| ID | Action | Owner | Priority | Due date | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CAPA-1 | [e.g., Add alert for archive lag] | [Name] | P0 | YYYY-MM-DD | Open |
| CAPA-2 | [e.g., Automate PVC expansion test] | [Name] | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD | Open |

Action items must be **SMART**: specific, measurable, assigned, with due dates.
